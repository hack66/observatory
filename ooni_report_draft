We’re running [[https://ooni.torproject.org/ | OONIprobe]] developed by the Tor project to investigate packet interception through Cypriot ISPs. Ooniprobe collects data about local interference with internet access, and detects surveillance, active bandwidth limitations, and other kinds of network interference. In the past (find more recent information) it was used to reveal that software such as T-Mobile's parental control WebGuard tool also blocked a number of websites including Newgrounds, Cosmopolitan Magazine, and the Tor Project itself as well as to confirm the take-down of news-websites in Palestine (Zhang, 2012).

Ooni collects data on individual computers about local interference with Internet access. The probe, developed by Tor engineers Arturo Filasto and Jacob Appelbaum, detects surveillance, active bandwidth limitations, and other types of network interference. According to OONI's mission statement, "This is a human rights observation project for the Internet. OONI seeks to observe levels of surveillance, censorship, and networked discrimination by networked authoritarian power structures."

We've so far run Ooni probe on Cytanet.
