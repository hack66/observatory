# observatory
This is a humble attempt to set-up or to begin thinking about setting-up an independent Cyprus-based Europe, Middle East and Africa Web / Internet Observatory. The purpose is to collect and analyze data on routes of data through EMEA, and to work with initiatives like OONI (Observatory of Internet Interference: A free global observation network for detecting censorship, surveillance and traffic manipulation on the internet) to promote evidence based policy making.
